alert()
- shows a notification popup with text


console.log()
- used to print what is inside the parentheses "()" on
  console DevTools in browser
* you can print multiple values by separating them with a
  comma (,)
* console.log(1, 3);


typeof
- used to show the type of the value


template literal
- first introduced in ES6/ES2015
- use back ticks (``)
- write a string and insert the variable right there
- insertion of variable is done by using "${<name>}"
* const something = "Hi";
const exampleString = `Hello ${something}`;

multi-line string
- before ES6/ES2015
-- using "\n\"
* console.log("Hello \n\
World
");

- ES6/ES2015 and above
-- just press enter
* console.log(`Hello
World
`);

* you cannot include a statement in a template literal


Number()
- is a function that converts strings to numbers
* 
year = "1991";
console.log(Number(year) + 18);

result: 2009
- returns "NaN" if string cannot be converted to a number
* NaN means Not a Number but it is a typeof number


String()
- is a function that converts numbers to strings
* 
year = 1991;
console.log(String(year));


Boolean()
- is a function that turns values to boolean values
* not much used due to the conversion should be implicit
  not explicit


prompt()
- similar to alert() but you can add an input to it
* this input can be stored in a variable
** 
const favourite = prompt("What's your favourite number?");


switch()
- compares (equality) value to multiple values
- controlled structure
- inside the parentheses is the value to be compared
- case/s in switch function
* you can do multiple lines of code for a single case
  without using curly brackets
* end your case with "break" to stop before the next case
* indication of new case is the usage of "case"
* you can use same lines of code to multiple cases just by
indicating the other case directly next line of the other
case and putting that lines of code to the most recent case
* default will run if no other cases are the same with the
  value
**
const day = "monday";

switch (day) {
  case "moday":
    console.log(`Plan course structure`);
    console.log(`Go to coding meetup`);
    break;
  case "tuesday":
    console.log(`Prepare theory videos`);
    break;
  case "wednesday":
  case "thursday":
    console.log(`Write code examples`);
    break;
  case "friday":
    console.log("Record videos");
    break;
  case "saturday":
  case "sunday":
    console.log(`Enjoy the weekend ;D`);
    break;
  default:
    console.log(`Not a valid day!`);
}

* use mostly for equality and not other comparison


The Conditional (Ternary) Operator
- like if-else statement but only one line
- returns a value therefore an expression
- can be used in a template literal
*
const age = 23;
age >= 18
  ? console.log(`I like to drink wine üç∑`)
  : console.log(`I like to drink water üíß`);
** "?" indicates the if statement
** ":" indicates the else statement
